Q12 to Q14 are subjective answers type questions, Answers them in their own words briefly

12. Is K sensitive to outliers?
Ans:-The k-means algoriythm is sensitive to the outliers .in this paper we propose a robust two stage k means clustering algorithms based 
on the observationpoint mechanism,which can accurately discover the cluster centers without the disturbance of outliers. 

13. Why is K means better?
Ans:-Guarantees convergence.can warm of centeroids.easily adapts to new examples.Generalizes to clusters of different shapes and sizes,
such as elliptical clusters.

14. Is K means a deterministic algorithm?
Ans:-The non deterministic nature of k means is due to its random selection of data points as initial centroid .method 
we propose an improved ,density based version of k means,which involves a novel and systematic method for selecting initial centroids
